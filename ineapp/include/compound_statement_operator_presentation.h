         * Method that is called by a parent to a child to tell the child to start the placement operation,

         * \ref PlacementNegotiator::requestArea followed by the parent's instance of one of
         * \ref PlacementNegotiator::allocateArea or \ref PlacementNegotiator::areaInsufficient until the data
         * managed by the child is processed and placed.
         *
         * \param[in] placementTracker       A pointer to the placement tracker that can be used to track and update
         *                                   status during a time-consuming placement operation.
         *
         * \param[in] parent                 Pointer to the parent presentation negotiator.  Provided so that the child
         *                                   does not have to do the bit of additional work to identify its parent.
         *
         * \param[in] childIdentifier        An identifier the parent uses to quickly identify the child.
         *
         * \param[in] nextSibling            A pointer to the next sibling under the parent.  This child can use this to
         *                                   determine if the next sibling's space requirements should be taken into
         *                                   account when allocating room for this child.
         *
         * \param[in] honorLeadingWhitespace If true, the child should honor, and not remove, whitespace at the left
         *                                   side of the string.
         *
         * \param[in] minimumTopSpacing      Spacing to apply above the first line of the placement area.  The value
         *                                   is primarily intended to be used to manage paragraph spacing.  A negative
         *                                   value indicates that there should be no imposed top spacing.
         *
         * \param[in] lineSpacing            Additional line spacing that should be optionally included by this child.
         *                                   Children can adjust the height they report for their presentation areas.
         *                                   A value of 1.0 indicates single spacing.  A value of 1.5 indicates 1 1/2
         *                                   line spacing.  A value of 2.0 indicates double spacing.
         *
         * \param[in] relativeScale          A hint value used to indicate if this child should try to scale smaller
         *                                   than usual. This value is intended for cases where an equation element
         *                                   needs to be rendered in a smaller than usual font.  A value of 1.0
         *                                   indicates normal scale.  The value is intended as a hint, children are not
         *                                   required to honor this parameter.
