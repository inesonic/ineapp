         *                                   does not have to do the bit of additional work to identify its parent.

         *
         * \param[in] lineSpacing            Additional line spacing that should be optionally included by this child.
         *                                   Children can adjust the height they report for their presentation areas.

         *                                   than usual. This value is intended for cases where an equation element
